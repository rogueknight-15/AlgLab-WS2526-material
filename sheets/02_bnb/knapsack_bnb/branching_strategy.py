"""
Branching Strategy Module

Defines how to split (branch) a BnB tree node when its current relaxed solution
is not yet a feasible integer solution. At each branching step:
 1. Select a decision variable that has not been fixed.
 2. Create two children by fixing that variable to 0 (exclude) and 1 (include).
 3. If all variables are fixed, no branches are returned (leaf node).

You should implement your own strategies by subclassing `BranchingStrategy`.
